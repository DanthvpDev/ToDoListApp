#Hey Coders!
This is my first attempt to create a To Do List App.
This app was a homework of a software development course at INA (Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje) where I was learning about web apps development.
I'm using vanilla JavaScrpit for programming the events and Tailwind to create the layout.

I hope this app would be useful.
